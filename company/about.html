    <p>I contemplate calling him and telling him about his favorite president, but my father would bury me in a thousand questions and my hour would dissolve like sugar in water.

        I grab a sandwich from the fridge and try to shake last night from my mind. Last night was the past. I don't deal in the past. I deal in the present. And presently, I'd wasted eighteen minutes of my day.
        
        I grab my phone, slip on my Asics, remember to grab a beanie, and run out the door.
        
        It is 3:26 a.m.
        
        I will have to cut my run short. I do a seven-minute mile out, then a six-minute mile back. By the time I stand beneath the streetlight, the same streetlight Connor Sullivan parked his car under a day earlier, it is 3:39.
        
        Twenty-one minutes.
        
        I turn and face the house. It is silent, as if the wrought iron gate surrounding it protects it from all threats, even sound. I pull my hand into my shirt sleeve and fiddle with the lock atop the gate. It unlatches and the gate swings open with a soft creak. I know what I'm about to do is wrong, both ethically and legally, but what if there is a woman in the house that needs help? It had been nearly twenty-four hours since the scream; she could feasibly still be alive. Right? Either way, you might be asking yourself, why wasn't I calling the police to come check it out?
        
        Simple.
        
        This was the most exciting thing to happen in my 14,000 hours of being awake.
        
        I slide through the opening in the gate, then tiptoe up the steps. There are two narrow panes of glass running vertically along the door and I lean forward and peer into the house. My eyes are still pinging with the light from the streetlamp and I can't make out a single shape. I lift my hand, still covered by my sleeve – I have no plans of leaving any fingerprints – and push down on the wrought iron handle. It gives and the door pushes inward.</p>
